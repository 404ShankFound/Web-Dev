    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;justify-content: space-between;">
    <p>
    Iâ€™m Shashank Nandan, born and brought up in the steel city of Bokaro, Jharkhand. Iâ€™ve always found joy in exploring new places and cultures, which has shaped my love for travelling. A true movie enthusiast at heart, I find storiesâ€”whether in films or web seriesâ€”fascinating, and yes, I proudly carry the skill of finishing an entire web series in a day! I'm someone who enjoys blending creativity with curiosity, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn, connect, and experience life beyond the pages of textbooks.<br>
    Academically, Iâ€™m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology at Manipal Institute of Technology. My interests in programming, data science, and problem solving have led me to gain hands-on experience with Python, Java, and C.
